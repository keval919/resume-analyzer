# resume-analyzer
This project is a basic Resume Analyzer tool built to demonstrate how candidate resumes can be parsed and analyzed against specific job requirements. It uses hardcoded job criteria to evaluate uploaded resumes and provide feedback on match percentage, missing skills, and suggestions for improvement.
